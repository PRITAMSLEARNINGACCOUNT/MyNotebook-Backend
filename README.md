This is a backend of My-Notebook app which is created using express.js.
I have completed the front-end of this webapp also which is also available on this github account.
It is basically a practice project which is done from a react crash course which is available on youtube for absolutely free by CodeWithHarry.
Lastly i want to say that this i deployed this whole backend on vercel previously i used netlify but this time i go with vercel And by making this project i have learned a way lot of things about web app development.
